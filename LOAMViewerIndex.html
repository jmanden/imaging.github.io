On this page, a data visualizer module has been coupled with data from the research paper "Radiation dose in CT-based active surveillance of small renal masses may be reduced by 75%: A retrospective exploratory multiobserver study".<br>
In this study radiologist observers (n=6) performed CT-based measurements of the maximal axial diameter of renal tumors (n=40) in both normal-dose and simulated 75% dose reduced CT scans.<br>
The data of this study is available in a <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/pf2bvmfsmb/2" target="_blank">data repository</a>.<br>
The data visualizer allows interactive exploration of plots of tumor diameters assessed by the observers based on the Limits of Agreement with the Mean (LOAM) statistical method proposed by Christensen et al.<br>
The data visualizer can call up screenshots of each measurement.<br>
Please see this demonstrational video (mangler).<br>
