<title>Data visualizer from the paper Dataset on renal tumor diameter assessment by multiple observers in normal-dose and low-dose CT</title>

<p style="font-size:18px">
On this page, a data visualizer module has been coupled with data from the research paper 
"<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772652522000199" target="_blank">
Radiation dose in CT-based active surveillance of small renal masses may be reduced by 75%: A retrospective exploratory multiobserver study</a>".<br>
In this study radiologist observers (n=6) performed CT-based measurements of the maximal axial diameter of renal tumors (n=40) in both normal-dose and simulated 75% dose reduced CT scans.<br>
The data of this study is available in a <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/pf2bvmfsmb/4" target="_blank">data repository</a>.<br>
The data visualizer allows interactive exploration of plots of tumor diameters assessed by the observers based on the Limits of Agreement with the Mean (LOAM) statistical method proposed by <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-020-01182-w" target="_blank">
Christensen et al</a>.<br>
The data visualizer can call up screenshots of each measurement.<br>
